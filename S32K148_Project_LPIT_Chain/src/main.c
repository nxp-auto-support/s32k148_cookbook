 * Description:
 * ==============================================================================================================
 * This example shows how to chain the LPIT0 channels to make a larger timer.
 * LPIT0 module contains 4 channels (0 - 3). Each channel could be used as an independent 32 bit timer.
 * LPIT0 channel n timeout value is stored in TVAL[n] register. This module counts backwards (from TVAL to 0),
 * so when the counter reaches 0, the timeout flag is asserted.
 *
 * If a larger timer is needed Channel 1 and Channel 2 can be chained together to get a 64 bit timer
 * or Channel 1, Channel 2 and Channel 3 can be chained together to get a 96 bit timer
 * Channel 0 can not be chained.
 *
 * In chain mode, the channel n decreases its counter every time channel n-1 timeouts flag is asserted.
 *
 * For this example, only Channel 1 and Channel 2 are being chained.
 * A LED will blink 5 times with a 1 second period. To count the blinking period, the
 * Channel 1 is used. To count how many times the LED has blinked Channel 2 is used.
 *
 * Channel 1 is set with a TVAL of 1s and Channel 2 is set with a TVAL of 10 counts.
 * In other words every 1s, the Ch1 timeout flag will be asserted and the Ch2 counting will decrease by 1,
 * meaning that after Ch1 timeout flag is asserted 10 times, the Ch2 timeout flag would be asserted as well.
 *
 * Remember 10 counts = 5 Blinks. The Ch1 toggles the LED from On to Off. This is
 * equal to 1 second on and 1 second off, repeating the cycle 10 times.
 *
 * Every time a LED turns on or off, Ch1 timeout flag is asserted. Every time the LED changes
 * its color, Ch2 timeout flag is asserted.
