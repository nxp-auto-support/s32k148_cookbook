/*!
 * Description:
 * ============================================================================================
 * Usage example of the FlexCAN's Pretended Networking (PNET) mode, for an alternating reception
 * and transmission of CAN Classic frames between two S32K1xx EVBs.
 * Message Buffer number 0 transmits frames with a 8-byte payload, and Wake Up Message Buffer 0 is
 * set up for receiving them at 250 Kbit/s; a green LED is toggled each time 1000 frames
 * are received by each board.
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Build the project, flash one of a pair of EVBs, then uncomment the BOARD_B macro located in line 56
 * and comment out the BOARD_A one, lastly, flash the last board. Perform CAN connections between
 * CAN_LO, CAN_HI and GND, set jumper J8 to 1-2 position and connect a 12V supply,
 * refer to the corresponding Cookbook documentation for detailed images.
