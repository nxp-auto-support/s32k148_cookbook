 * Description:
 * ========================================================================================================
 * The TRGMUX provides an extremely flexible mechanism for connecting various trigger sources
 * to multiple pins/peripherals.
 *
 * In this example LPUART1, CMP0 and LPIT0 Ch0 are connected to each other using the TRGMUX module.
 * However, notice that many more options are available in the S32K1xx_Trigger_Muxing.xlsx attached file
 * in the Reference Manual, so it is possible to set different triggers for different modules.
 *
 * The basic steps to set a trigger source for a module are:
 * 		- Select the trigger source for the desired module in the TRGMUX register
 * 		- Select/enable the trigger input for the desired module (registers are different according to the module)
 *
 * For this project, the trigger sources are set as follows:
 *
 * 		LPIT0_CH0 ---- (triggers) ---> CMP0 ---- (triggers) ----> LPUART1
 *
 * Notice that the order is important, a different order or different modules may require different configurations.
 * Trigger the LPUART1 with the CMP0 is not the same as trigger the CMP0 with the LPUART1.
 *
 * In other words, the LPIT0_CH0 is set with a value of 4s. After this time, the timeout flag is asserted.
 *
 * Until the timeout flag is asserted, not before, CMP0 module performs a sample reading from
 * the CMP0_IN0 pin (PTA0) and compares the input voltage with a desired threshold (2.5 V).
 * The result from the comparison is visible in the CMP0_OUT pin (PTE3). This means that every
 * 4s a CMP0 sample is triggered by the LPIT0_CH0
 *
 * 		If CMP0_IN0 > 2.5 V      CMP0_OUT = 1     Green LED on
 *		If CMP0_IN0 < 2.5 V      CMP0_OUT = 0     Red LED on
 *
 * Also, when the CMP0_OUT = 1, the LPUART1 sends a message. If CMP0_OUT = 0, the message will not be sent.
 * This means that the LPUART1 is triggered by the CMP0_OUT.
 *
 * Remember that is not enough to select the trigger source in the TRIGMUX register, additional configurations
 * may be done. For example:
 *
 * 		CMP0: Enable the Window Mode sampling. Allows to be triggered by a timer.
 * 		      CMP0 -> C0 =  CMP_C0_WE_MASK
 * 		      LPIT0_CH0 is selected as trigger source in the TRGMUX register
 *
 *   	LPUART1: Select to modulate the TXD pin output with an input trigger
 * 		         LPUART1 -> PINCFG = LPUART_PINCFG_TRGSEL(0b11);
 * 		         CMP0_OUT is selected as trigger source in the TRGMUX register
 *
 * NOTE: To change the input voltage for the CMP0 sampling, connect with a jumper or cable, the
 *       CMP0_IN0 pin (PTA0) with the potentiometer output (PTC28) of the EVB
 *       To see the LPUART1 messages, TeraTerm or other software could be used.
