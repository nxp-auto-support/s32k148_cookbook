/*!
 * Description:
 * ============================================================================================
 * Usage example of the FlexCAN module, for an alternating reception and transmission
 * of CAN-FD frames between two S32K1xx EVBs.
 * Message Buffer number 0 transmits frames with a 64-byte payload, and Message Buffer 1 is
 * set up for receiving them at 4 Mbit/s and 1 Mbit/s in data and nominal phases respectively;
 * a green LED is toggled each time 1000 frames
 * are received by each board.
 *
 * This example also shows the High Speed Run (HSRUN) mode configuration for the FlexCan module.
 * Notice that there might be some issues according to the physical transceiver used, check the
 * maximum speed that it can handle in its data-sheet
 *
 * Instructions:
 * Build the project, flash one of a pair of EVBs, then uncomment the BOARD_B macro located in line 56
 * and comment out the BOARD_A one, lastly, flash the last board. Perform CAN connections between
 * CAN_LO, CAN_HI and GND, set jumper J8 to 1-2 position and connect a 12V supply,
 * refer to the corresponding Cookbook documentation for detailed images.
